A clean, interactive web application that helps users organize daily tasks.
Users can add, check off, and delete to-dos, each with an optional due date.
The app also features built-in validation to ensure only valid tasks are added, and it automatically resets the form after each successful submission.

Mark as Complete: Check off tasks to visually indicate completion.

Delete Tasks: Remove tasks individually using the “Delete” button.

Form Validation: Prevents submitting empty or invalid tasks.

Automatic Reset: After a successful submission, the form clears and disables the button until valid input is entered again.

Responsive Design: Works smoothly on desktop and mobile screens.
